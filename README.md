This is a Python-based flashcard learning app that helps users learn French vocabulary using a spaced repetition approach. Built with tkinter for the GUI and pandas for data handling, the app shows French words and flips the card after a few seconds to reveal the English translation. Users can mark words as known, which dynamically updates and saves a custom list of words to learn for future sessions.
